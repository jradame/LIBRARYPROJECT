# LIBRARYPROJECT

A responsive web application built with React that simulates an online bookstore. Users can browse books, view ratings, filter and sort by price or rating, and see which books are on sale. The project demonstrates how to build dynamic, component-driven interfaces with React while handling state management and rendering data-driven UI.

## Features

- **Dynamic Book Listings**  
  All book data is rendered from a data file with reusable components for displaying book cards.

- **Sorting and Filtering**  
  Users can sort books by price (low-to-high, high-to-low) or by rating.

- **Ratings System**  
  A star-based rating component shows the quality of each book visually.

- **Discount Detection**  
  Automatically shows books that are on sale by comparing original and sale prices.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Built with modern CSS to adapt cleanly across desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **React** – component-based UI
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS3**
- **FontAwesome** – icons for ratings and UI elements
